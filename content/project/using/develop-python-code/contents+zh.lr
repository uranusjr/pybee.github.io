BeeWare isn't just a set of tools to help you run Python code on different platforms; it's also a collection of tools to help you write, debug and tune your Python code.

`Cricket`_ is a tool that helps projects with large test suites identify failures without waiting for all your tests to finish.

`Duvet`_ is a tool to display coverage data from a test run.

`Bugjar`_ is a graphical debugger.

`Galley`_ is a tool to let you easily preview your Sphinx documentation as you write it.

`Podium`_ is a slideshow presentation tool that you can use to tell others about your project.
